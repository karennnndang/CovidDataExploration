# CovidDataExploration

This repository contains the COVID databases and SQL queries that I have been playing around with. All files are related to Covid data. There is an OUTDATED version and UPDATED version of each SQL query. They contain the same databases but with more results from the UPDATED Covid database.

**Note:
Updated COVID death and COVID vaccination excel workbooks could not be uploaded due to large data within workbooks.

**Listed below is the Tableau Public data visualization that correlates with the Covid data in this query. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karen.dang6055/viz/CovidOutdatedDashboard/Dashboard1
