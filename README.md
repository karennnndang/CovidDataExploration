# CovidDataExploration

This repository contains the databases and SQL queries for professional portfolio. All files are related to Covid and therefore there is an OUTDATED version and UPDATED
version. They contain the same databases but with more results from the UPDATED.

**Note:
Updated COVID death and COVID vaccination excel workbooks could not be uploaded due to large data within workbooks.
